## ABSTRACT

The highly polyphagous Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni Froggatt) expanded its range substantially during the twentieth century and is now the most economically important insect pest of Australian horticulture. We have screened for variation in key environmental fitness traits among populations from across the geographic range of this species, and changes in those traits induced during domestication. Significant variation was detected between the populations for heat, desiccation and starvation resistance and wing length (as a measure of size). This variation was not correlated with latitude but some weak correlations with climate variables were found. Desiccation bioassay studies of three populations that were resampled in subsequent years indicate that much of the variation in this trait reflects persistent, inherited differences among the populations. Desiccation resistance was correlated with both starvation resistance and wing length. All three of these measures, and heat resistance, decreased in certain populations with ongoing domestication but there was also a strong population by domestication interaction effect for each trait.
